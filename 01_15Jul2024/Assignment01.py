name = input("User Name")
Age = input("Enter your age")
City = input ("Enter your city")
PhoneNo = input ("Enter your PhoneNumber")
#name,Age,City,PhoneNo = input ("Name","Age","City","PN") - This doesnot work


# print(name,Age,City,PhoneNo) - This too works
print(name)
print(Age)
print(City)
print(PhoneNo)
